										<h1>Project Idea</h1>
									</header>
												<h3>Overview</h3>
											</header>
									<p> My project will be a mobile application that can turn the kitchen into a smarter place in the house. Therefore, I came up with Fridgee, an app that will help people to manage food in the kitchen. The app will be integrated with AI to detect the food you have, remind you of the expiry dates, suggest a balanced diet to you based on the food you buy. You can also type in your condition and Fridgee will know exactly what nutrition plan you need. </p>
									<header class="major">
												<h3>Motivation</h3>
											</header>
									<a href="https://scitechdaily.com/food-waste-study-reveals-much-fridge-food-goes-there-to-die/"> Scientific research</a>
									<p>People’s life is getting busier and busier to an extent that that they actually cannot pay attention to everything in their house, namely food. Or it is just because they are so forgetful or too lazy to clean their kitchen once every week. For example, my mother now still has some food that she bought all the way back from 2017, because there is too much and the packages just get stuck in a very deep corner of the cupboard. And there are no really smart household appliances for kitchen at the moment. That is why I want to make one.</p>
									<header class="major">
												<h3>Description</h3>
											</header>
									<p>When you come home from supermarket or market, you take the food, which could be packages, fresh food, or boxes, out of bags, and place it inside cupboard, fridge, or on your dining table. While doing that, you skim through all the specific information on the package, and you think about what to cook. But as soon as you finish, you forget all about it, because there is just a plethora of words and numbers to process, and you end up with whatever you think tastes best, or even eat some snacks. This is where Fridgee comes in to play: instead of skimming with your eyes, scan the food with Fridgee, and everything you need to know will be stored in the app. With AI technology it will be able to detect the food, read the expiry dates, the ingredients, and classify into different categories.
With the information it stores the app will be able to remind you about the expiry dates prior to the number of days of your choice, so no food will be wasted. And if you don’t know how to store the food correctly, Fridgee will give you information about methods to keep the food fresh and clean, such as temperature, places to keep, humidity, and so on. This will be extremely useful for people who live alone and have no house helper. Health is also a very important factor, so you and your family can set up a profile in the app, which includes basic information about your allergy or your health condition if you have one. Fridgee is actually not a qualified doctor, but based on the information about you and the food, it will basically sort out what food contains the ingredient that will cause you allergy, and which one is fatty or sugary so people with diabetes or obesity will avoid it.
Imagine coming home after an exhausting, long day at work or school, you open the fridge and there is so much fresh food that would definitely discourage you from getting your hand on each slide of fresh meat, or each kind of vegetable. Don’t worry, we have all been there, and Fridgee got you! The app will suggest you a healthy menu based on the food you have, and of course the recipes, which will be updated regularly on the database, if you don’t know how to make it. The app can even give you the information about the calories of each dish so you can have total control of the calories intake each day.
Based on the scientific reasoning of what you should eat every week, Fridgee will come up with a list of what should be in your fridge the next time you go shopping for food. For example, you need 5-7 servings of vegetables, salad and fruit per day, so the app will suggest you to buy more apples, lettuce, and cucumbers, and the list will of course be dynamic and diverse. Combined with your personal profile, the list will be even more specific.</p>

												<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
											</header>
									<p>The app may require, but not limited to, these technologies and tools. Cloud computing accessibility is one, as it will need to access a large database of information about the food, as well as storing information of customers. AI/Deep learning/Machine learning frameworks would be integrated to the app as information would be analyzed under the form of photos of the objects and texts through photos, where TensorFlow Lite for Android mobile devices or Core ML/Create ML for iOS mobile devices would be appropriate. I have to use JAVA as my coding language since it is one of the main languages for mobile apps.</p>
									<header class="major">
												<h3>Skills required</h3>
											</header>
									<p>To make this app, I will have to learn about AI/Machine learning/Deep learning concepts and how to work with them and operate with the frameworks and engines. Knowledge about cloud computing is also necessary, and also how to use JAVA language, so that I will know how to create the platform. UI/UX design is also important, as I need to make it easy to access for everyone, and a little bit of graphics design also to make it look appealing.</p>
									<header class="major">
												<h3>Outcome</h3>
											</header>
									<p>With this app, everything in the kitchen would be simpler and more interesting. People would have someone, in this case a smart app, to care about their health by analyzing what they eat on a daily basis. They would also save a lot food, money, and time if they change their kitchen habit and use this app regularly. And this should be very useful for someone who starts to live independently. People would be able to focus more on other things and boost their productivity.</p>
