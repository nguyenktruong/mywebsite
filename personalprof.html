												<h3>What do the results of these tests mean?</h3>
												<p>As the results below suggest, I am a mediator, I learn most by doing, and I use a creative approach to problem solve with a relatively wide vision. However, the test results rather surprised me that I have always been someone who put emotions above logical thoughts. On the other hand, the learning style test is accurate, as I have to put my hand on something before getting to know every part of it, and my creativity test implies that I am a person with a lot of ideas.</p>

												<h3>Behaviour in a team</h3>
												<p>In working with a team scenario, caring about emotions is not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, based on these results, I think I would be the one who tries to understand and analyze all my teammatesâ€™ feelings and working habits, and that would enable me to work well with anyone coming from any type of personality. I love learning by doing. I would put every effort in doing my tasks, and I would care about the outcome of my projects, like how they would affect people, not only about the financial outcome. Moreover, I would come up with a lot of viably interesting ideas, not just about fantasy and pseudoscience, and try to bring them to reality with my team. I work well as an individual, but I would always think as a team.</p>

												<h3>When forming a team</h3>
												<p>I strongly believe that any type of personality can always work well together, as long as one knows who he or she is, and one must have the key factors of a teammate: reliability and responsibility. Each person has his or her own way to solve a problem as well as advantages and disadvantages. It is good to know the personality of each one, but how you deal with it does not really matter to the big picture of teamwork. Finish your task, respect and help each other, and you will eventually move forward with your team. With that mindset, I am comfortable and confident with my performance within a group project.</p>
